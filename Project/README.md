# Project

This project is aimed to build a end-to-end neural network focusing on one topic yet to be chosen.

The first step is, obviously, to choose what to do. These are the possibilities:


- [ ] Multimodal with DenseNet (the small one) (keras implementation or keras_contrib). Using for example Twitter API (text, image?)
- [ ] Try image captioning
- [ ] Try video summarization (most important frames)
